# Programming Framework for Clinical Image Analysis
<p>PFCA(Programming Framework for Clinical Image Analysis(PFCA) is an open-source python library to preprocess and analyse radiological images, mainly MRI. The repository is the result of my efforts in the undergraduate thesis that mainly focused on the detection of cerebral microbleeds in MRI images of patients. The library contains helper functions for frequently used preprocessing operations in MRI. I have also curated the 3d visualisation functions in Mayavi to visualise the brain segments.</p>
